# 🧠 Java Design Patterns - Practical Examples

This repository contains practical and easy-to-understand Java implementations of common **Creational** and **Behavioral** Design Patterns.

---

## ✅ Implemented Patterns

### 🔁 Singleton Pattern
Implements four different types of Singleton:
- **Eager Initialization**
- **Lazy Initialization**
- **Thread-Safe Singleton** (using synchronized method)
- **Bill Pugh Singleton** (recommended approach)

Also includes:
- **Synchronized Method Singleton**
- **Synchronized Block Singleton (Double-Checked Locking)**

📁 Package: `singleton`

---

### 🔄 Template Method Pattern
Demonstrates the Template Method pattern through:
- A **HotDrink preparation example** with Tea and Coffee.
- A **User Registration** system for Admin and Guest users.

📁 Package: `template.method`

---

### 🏭 Factory Pattern
Practical example illustrating how to use the Factory Pattern:
- **Light Switch Factory**, which returns different types of switchable lamps.

📁 Package: `factory`

---

### 👀 Observer Pattern
A real-world simulation of the Observer pattern using:
- A **YouTube Channel** (Subject) and multiple **Subscribers** (Observers).
- When the channel uploads a video, all subscribers are notified.

📁 Package: `observer`

## 💡 Why These Patterns?

These design patterns are foundational in software engineering and can:
- Improve code **flexibility**
- Enhance **modularity**
- Promote **reusability** and **scalability**
